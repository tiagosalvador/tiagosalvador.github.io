I'm a post-doctoral researcher at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) working at the intersection of applied math, deep learning and machine learning. My main focus is in computer vision, developing algorithms for domain adaptation and out-of-distribution uncertainty problems.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral Assistant Professor at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in applied math, working on threshold dynamics algorithms which are ideal for large scale simulations of grain growth. I did my PhD in applied mathematics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) supervised by [Professor Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/). My research focused on developing numerical methods for partial differential equations.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
